I wish there was more discussion of the nuance between "users, alienated from the concept of labor, ask huge amounts of work from devs, especially if they don't know how much a change actually takes"

and "software writers need to not make promises they cannot keep about scope or applicable use cases"

because there's a middle ground somewhere there where the useful part probably lies. but so far you can't even see it because the extremes are so bright and loud.

I'm thinking about how much I've heard "literally unplayable" from gamers over tiny things that they throw tantrums over, and similar on social media when the font is wrong or whatever, and like. that weighs on devs, even the jokes. especially the jokey tantrums. I hope the seven likes were worth it.

it feels like a lot of people had the theory of mind area of their brain just completely erased.

I don't know how much of that is it being a learned skill (even for allists!) has largely been erased and replaced with "oh bad theory of mind if just autism, they can't possibly improve it" (again, false, it's a learned skill if you ignore the pathologizing half of the ToM literature).

and how much is from gaming/online cultural norms, but like.

fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck, man.
