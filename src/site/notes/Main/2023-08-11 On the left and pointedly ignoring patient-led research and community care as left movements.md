[[2023-08-11\|2023-08-11]]

its very interesting that the left as a whole hasn't bothered to embrace or even look into the patient-led medical research and care communities where doctors have largely abandoned the 'rare' illnesses

especially when they much more resemble the structures of [[mutual aid\|mutual aid]] than most left mutual aid projects do.
