I'm starting to think a resource that needs to exist is like, onboarding documentation for "my employees just said they're unionizing, how do I do them good" but I haven't seen much.

most of the union resources from the left are about creating one

and most results that are about the employer for "my employees are forming a union" on Google are anti-union but couched in inclusive language.

and i wonder how many clueless small employers crush their unions simply because of that. I know most have other motives, but ignorant harm through confident incompetence has been the theme of the last three to thirteen yearsÂ _at least_.
