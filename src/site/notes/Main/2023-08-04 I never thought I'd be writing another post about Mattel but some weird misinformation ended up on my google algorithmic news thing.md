this is a website known for fake news. It got picked up by Google headlines.  I wouldn't recommend clicking on it.

[https://insidethemagic.net/2023/08/mattel-to-end-barbie-production-after-federal-plastic-ban-jtc1/](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/08/mattel-to-end-barbie-production-after-federal-plastic-ban-jtc1/) [archive link](https://archive.ph/G3DF8)

which is patiently absurd for an entirely plastic company and I thought they were twisting the words of a presser. a quick Google shows they're trivially fake news to anyone who bothers, but it's worse.

[https://mattel-corporate.com/news/mattel-announces-plans-to-go-plastic-free-by-2030](https://mattel-corporate.com/news/mattel-announces-plans-to-go-plastic-free-by-2030) is linked in there as the source, but a quick Google finds mattel is corporate.mattel.com, and a simple whois shows mattel-corporate.com is registered at njalla.

anyway I've done my due diligence and offloaded this into a customer support form with "escalate this to security, they don't have a form for imposter submissions"

but i still can't tell if this is an elaborate phishing scam or just a lot of work for some clicks
