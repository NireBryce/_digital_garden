Someone in the comments to the original cohost post of [[Main/2023-08-02 on movements, I guess.\|2023-08-02 on movements, I guess.]] had asked how to learn more about municipal level movement building while starting from scratch.

This is the response:

This doesn't answer your question, but does help build an intuition of the landscape of a movement.

but that aside, to actually answer the question: part of why I'm having trouble remembering resources for this is that it's at the heart of most of them, people just don't really get the takeaway from most of them because it's taken for granted.

you don't win with propaganda victories and someone shouting in Congress, you build things that bring people together around common goals where you can talk. movements are just shared ideas, with one specific one that is always nonoptional:

### Nothing is static, not even the current moment, and change is possible.

you be surprised how many people aren't there yet, but getting them to that point usually just means, being around more people.

in the US, it helps to focus that power at the city council level first -- can you get enough people in your neighborhood district on your side and involved enough that, if you're working electoral angles, you can pretty much guarantee an election? It's time to put pressure on candidates and just elect your own if they don't bend the knee. then more council seats, ideally stay with the lines of a state house district. then multiple, then state Senate.

you aren't building support for your city, you're building support to parasitize the Democratic party, and election system, from within, while making your policies stick in ways they get passed around. five federal House representatives have very little power outside of propaganda. ten state house reps who are working together and acting in concert pass state laws, that can spread to other states.

it's important for activists putting their work towards non-electoral routes to try to follow these lines where they can, because it allows you to create the same parallel structures.

### you don't need to complete for mindshare

people will often self sort into where they can best apply their skills
