[[2023-07-22\|2023-07-22]]

so I was reading [https://taliaringer.wordpress.com/2023/07/22/full-circle/](https://taliaringer.wordpress.com/2023/07/22/full-circle/)  
and an unrelated thing really jumped out at me.

> I’ve tried to get into blogging before. I couldn’t keep it up last time. I got too obsessed with everything being perfect, so writing posts felt like a huge chore. “I am going to do my best to not obsess over that here,” I type into the text editor with a totally straight face as I obsessively spend the next ten minutes thinking of what header text to use for the next section. Godspeed.

the secret to blogging is it's a skill, and the blog process + web publishing are tools you have/need/build skills for. most things are skills. it will both take more time and suck more than anyone else, the first time you do anything.

if you convince yourself it should be easy, you will never do it, because it's not easy for the first, ten, maybe twenty posts in the same way your first twenty times using a drill you probably made some great holes and some really terrible ones.

you just gotta like, do it. putting time in to throw yourself at things like typesetting probably won't help that much, but if it keeps you _thinking about it_ then you're still learning something. And you get a sense for headers way faster. but it'll take ten minutes of agony every time if you never play with them.
