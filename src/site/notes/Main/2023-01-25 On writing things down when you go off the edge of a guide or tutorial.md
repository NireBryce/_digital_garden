[[2023-01-25\|2023-01-25]]

I'm really bad at doing it myself. but as an aspirational reminder:

### if you use an online guide and then go any further than it: if you can, please write your own tiny blog on the steps after, and link back to the original

it doesn't need to be much, just "I did this, but then went on to do these steps this way because "

the only way we make progress on anything outside of academia is by iterative increments, building off the people before. Same way the discovery of Writing let you build off of previous things without having to experience them in person.

"Open-Source knowledge" for lack of a better name, is usually single people summarizing their sources and the path they took, we aren't paid textbook authors, we're rarely teams. The way you make progress is that way is with small updates on each other, building the next step for the next person to iterate on.

Books on these sorts of things are cool, but often a very high time investment for how little they sell. doing it distributed by "I read this, then I did more" means you can rapidly grow the gestalt by simply writing down what you did.

there's nothing formal, just scrappy quick and dirty blogs. Computer people already do this, albeit not well, and it's a big part of why it's a field that's self teachable as... smoothly as it is. But i see it less and less for anything else but games as things move to discord

you can't build on stuff inside a discord. not easily, at least.

Thinking a lot about fandom.com killing gameFAQs text posts.
