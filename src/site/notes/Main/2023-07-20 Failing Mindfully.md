an important skill to cultivate is 'failing mindfully'

when you start failing something, making a mistake, etc, it's worth paying attention to it and getting the most learning you can out of it -- it's doomed to fail, but you might not be.

most of my important learned things were from paying attention to everything burning down.

but if you see failure as world-ending or a slight on you or whatever, you're likely to black-hole it instead of learning from it. it's a hard skill to develop if you're constantly in that state, but one of the most impactful ways out of it, too.
