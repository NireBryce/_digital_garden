because on some level, as much as game hackers are a terrible experience, some people are only able to play through the use of cheatengine and the like to edit their controls, convert one sense to another (sound to "visual radar display" that would be considered a hack, etc), augment impaired vision with situational zoom, etc.

who are we banning just to keep the hackers out, because we can't have the staff to deal with them in other ways?

and equally important, if we still think banning home grown solutions is the path, why aren't we talking as if these should at least be assumed to be a required part of design? like, at the unreal/unity engine level, or well publicized libraries for other frameworks.

every few months I remember the article about DCSS unintentionally being one of the few complex games blind/visually-impaired people could play because you could have it list out targets and ranges in a way a screen reader could read

and my own issues that would be better with things designers didn't implement but I could on top of it

edit: I think most people this ends up in the laps of will have watched or seen the discussion of Folding Ideas' ["Why It's Rude to Suck at Warcraft] ([https://youtu.be/BKP1I7IocYU](https://youtu.be/BKP1I7IocYU)) and while you can do what you want, as I mentioned in later self-shares of this post people aren't arriving here from, that covers about a third of the territory here, and misses a lot of the interplay.
