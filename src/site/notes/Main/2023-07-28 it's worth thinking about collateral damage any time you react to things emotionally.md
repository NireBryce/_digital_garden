# it's worth thinking about collateral damage any time you react to things emotionally

linking the @spiders' [post](https://cohost.org/spiders/post/2250541-explaining-to-my-fri) about collateral shame and autism

the tldr is that people complaining about people playing guitar at parties made it really hard to play guitar around people

and yeah. it also extends past autism, but autism can often make the threshhold for it lower, or people misunderstand.

but I'm gonna go further and say that like, as I've said in countless posts, the idea of "cringe" has collateral damage (and is inherently fascistic with it's implicit social surveillance)

and so can minor complaints everyone has but _generalizes for brevity_

I know it's not as bad as the suicide bait posts but it's still good to like. think a lil bit before saying a thing. especially if you're in a position of (relative) social power within a pocket of community, or often speak with authority (intentionally or not, qualified or not) on other things.

they're little things but like, if you want to break the cycles you kinda have to like, actually do that. across all things. or you're helping contribute to them probably-unintentionally.

### and if you're a leftist or anti-capitalist, know that doing these things both reflects kinda badly on your principles, and aids your enemy as it's part of their systems of social control (though likely organic instead of international). Don't make our jobs harder for dopamine, c'mon.
