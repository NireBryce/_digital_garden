#art #sociophenomenology #cohost-repost
[[2023-07-07\|2023-07-07]]

it feels like a lot of people see art that's going

> this is what happened, here's how it can go, here's how it resolved, learn from our mistakes

and otherwise read it as

> this is bad don't do this

even though it's essentially inevitable that it happens

for... a whole lot of things.

and i don't know ways to guide them to the realization. not that it's necessary, it just feels incredibly common lately
