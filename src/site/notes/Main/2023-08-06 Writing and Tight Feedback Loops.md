[[2023-08-06\|2023-08-06]]

thinking about how the boom in knowledge-sharing wasn't desktop publishing, but making it so that editing what you wrote wasn't a write, then edit, then write.

you can move things around experimentally, you can see how things sound and remove them easily, you can more easily go for clarity in-the-moment when you realize using + instead of "and" will disambiguate with the other "and".

you could do that with painstaking exacto-knife and glue, but computers and especially HTML really changed it. Typewriters still had the same problem as writing -- you could do minor edits, but not to the _structure_ of the piece in flight.

and so much of my thinking and insight comes from the act of moving things around to clarify to a (fictitious or not) reader. like using an IDE for thinking.  Someone wrote a blog on this, maybe [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)?
