thinking about how the concepts of 'mindfulness' and 'mindfulness meditation' being decontextualized-noun'd (and by extension, in a sense, enclosed) being talked about the way they are is the opposite of mindfulness

mindfulness isÂ _paying attention to what you're experiencing, when you're experiencing it_, it's focusing on the food you're eating, or the people you're with, or the experience you're having, and not 'time to go be mindful :) im so glad I'm able to practice being mindful two hours a day :)"

it's the opposite of habituation-desensitization -- when you eat you pay attention to the aspects of the food instead of the food just being a thing while you do other stuff, etc. mindful sex being when you pay attention to the other person instead of it being just a thing you do, etc.

and it's stunning how fast it's been consultant-ized into what it is
