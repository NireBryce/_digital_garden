#  Smart patterning for topological pumping of elastic surface waves (4d holography)
summary from a friend:
> Combining this with the recent superconductor science would let them build logic circuits that operate losslessly on Cooper pairs

> Topological pumping allows waves to navigate a sample undisturbed by disorders and defects. We demonstrate this phenomenon with elastic surface waves by strategically patterning an elastic surface to create a synthetic dimension. The surface is decorated with arrays of resonating pillars that are connected by spatially slow-varying coupling bridges and support eigenmodes located below the sound cone. We establish a connection between the collective dynamics of the pillars and that of electrons in a magnetic field by developing a tight-binding model and a WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) analysis. This enables us to predict the topological pumping pattern, which we validate through numerical and experimental steering of waves from one edge to the other. Furthermore, we observe the immune nature of the topologically pumped surface waves to disorder and defects. The combination of surface patterning and WKB analysis provides a versatile platform for controlling surface waves and exploring topological matter in higher dimensions.
