I had never heard *anything* about this as an internet phenomenon, or about the wider influence of the internet, until now.  But it makes a lot of sense.

And I found the post, or at least one of them.

Reposting the excerpt, and [the link (GWU's archive of writings about various FOIAed things)](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/storm.htm).

> As Webb began giving out his story's Mercury Center website address ([http://www.sjmercury.com/drugs/](http://www.sjmercury.com/drugs/)) on radio shows in early September, the number of hits to the Center's site escalated dramatically, some days reaching as high as 1.3 million. Over all, Bob Ryan, who heads Mercury Center, estimates a 15% visitor increase since the stories appeared. "For us," he says, "it has certainly answered the question: Is there anyone out there listening?"

African-American talk-show hosts used their programs to address the allegations of CIA complicity in the crack epidemic, and the public response was forceful. The power of talk radio was demonstrated when Congresswoman Maxine Waters was a guest on WOL's Lisa Mitchell show in Baltimore on September 10, and announced that the Congressional Black Caucus meeting that week would address the issues raised by "Dark Alliance." Two hundred people were expected; nearly two thousand attended.
