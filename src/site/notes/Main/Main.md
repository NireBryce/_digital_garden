Hey, I'm Nire Bryce.  I'll add a rel-me link eventually.  But I think it probably comes through in the posts c:

this site is a work in progress because I am busy and tired and forever-sick.
but for the sake of getting posts out, here it is.

these are all rough draft quality, in the spirit of blogging.

If you want to contact me, you can send me an ask on cohost, or email me at contact@ on this domain.  I'll read them, though it may take me awhile to respond.
