this isn't financial advice. I am not a doctor, or a lawyer.

Twitter and reddit were 'the public square' whether we like it or not. A pretty big slice of 'everyone' was there, across all income brackets.

### Every. Class. Was. There.

Twitter, reddit, youtube, netflix, etc have increased their fees or made their things more obtuse.

### They Have Gone After The Only Real Third Spaces For The Ruling Class That Isn't High Protocol.

a writers strike is happening. The HBO-Warner merger means a whole lot of shows got canceled.

Games have been getting terrible, to extract more money. In ways that make them tedious and boring, nearly across the board.

### They Have Gone After The __Fun__ Of The Ruling Class. And Also Their Addictions, In The Colloquial Sense

That alone sets us up for interesting things.

But because these are cross-cutting concerns,

## The "Despondent/Downwardly Mobile Middle-Lower-Middle Class" Has A Lot More Free Time

now this. this is the thing that can tip us into A Cool Zone. The working class having less ways to blow off steam is important too, but the moderates being uncomfortable, the people most able to defect and become class traitors and pour money into things:? Are going to have a period where most of their money sinks are gone, everything sucks, rent is high, jobs are low, and the rich could simply end it by ending the strikes and being less terrible, which they won't.

I know all of us on the left despise the middle class as a concept, but here I think it matters. A lot of people ignore the "professional managerial class" but lemmie tell you, a whole lot of them are disgruntled from being fucked with too.

the time is ripe, it might be worth targeting them with your work if you see openings. And building infrastructure if things do get dicey, to onboard people and to mobilize 'em or whatever the shit.

I'm half asleep, so like, this is a 1/8th of a rough draft. I could def word it better. But by then I'd forget. Send tweet.
