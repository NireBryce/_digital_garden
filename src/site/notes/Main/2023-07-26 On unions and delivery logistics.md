y'ever think about how if we had strong unions we could pay delivery drivers enough that we don't need 1.5x the weight in plastic to receive a package? but right now due to time and low pay a lot of packages just get tossed around by handlers?

i wonder what the climate impact of that would be. certainly better than where each company's climate indulgences budget is going.

or regulations for a standard package size so you can use reusable Package Frames which get added by machine in the sorter
