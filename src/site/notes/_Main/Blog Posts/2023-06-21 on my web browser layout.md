I answered a comment with entirely too much text, so you get to have it too

I treat my browser windows as project containers, and so I suspend them entire windows at a time and keep 2x2 open most of the time. It's unclear how much of this is because my immediate-term-memory is extremely low-endurance/capacity.

I use one of the many session manager extensions for this, in this case Tabs Outliner but you could use most of them, and I throw it in git and some cloud vault and my backup scheme.
it's cool.
