I get that progress is slow and talking to people is hard, but Just Doing Things or Telling People To Do Things gets less people on our side per time investment and we need to aim for scale.

maybe it's different in the big cities but I doubt it, outside of having more people who are curious.

but maybe that's because I view movements as pedagogical and logistical more than about action -- once the background is there, the rest flows from it.

so many previous movements that chased the car and then caught up with it ended up falling apart because people were driven by fervor and FOMO and pressure, so were doing the actions but didn't have their brain in the right place and helped things fall apart.

party building, commune building, etc are pulling carts before horses. You have to build the popular support first imo. Which we don't have and never really did.

Sure, people support them with their words, but that's not what I mean.
