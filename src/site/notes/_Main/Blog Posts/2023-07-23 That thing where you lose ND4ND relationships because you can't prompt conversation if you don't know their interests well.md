i wish i had better ways to navigate the thing where I keep ending up being unidirectionally faulted when someone close and I run out of things to talk about, and our interests diverge, and our lives get busy with things that don't prompt sharing like work or doctors or studies we struggle with.

and i get that some of it is because I'm just letting it happen but like, that's two way.

and no one really... means it like that, but it is the reality, especially when i like. disclaim this up front.

and like. usually I put in more work trying to prompt things, in retrospect, which makes it suck more. and it's no one's fault but i really am tired of having my unwillingness to be pushy be on me. or the responsibility of learning when the bad/checked out time is over.
