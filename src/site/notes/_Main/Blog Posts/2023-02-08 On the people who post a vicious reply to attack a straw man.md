[[2023-02-08\|2023-02-08]]

this is widespread so I'll broadcast it without mentioning people in particular because it's everywhere. this is not about that book

tldr, coming in guns blazing because of meaning you ascribe to a post that isn't actually there, isn't a way to win the hearts and minds of people on your side. if you always assume malace you'll just have people JFL¹ instead of guess if they'll be randomly stabbed because of people reading into things. people who ascribe to your end of ~*~ideology~*~ probably aren't opposed to you, until they become opposed to _you_. break the cycle instead of subjecting people to it.

I'm tired of having people on my side shoot me in their foot.
