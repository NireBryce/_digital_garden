I don't think enough people thinking about geopolitics in my generation actually read about the Gulf War. it's much deeper than this but the Wikipedia page is a surprisingly good summary.

It was a slaughter, overwhelming force, in and out in a month. I need you to let that sink in.

a month.  I'm just saying. 

A big chunk of it occurred over two days.

I don't hear much about it from people talking about US/NATO aggression.

but it sent a message about resisting too much. It started the nineties.  The atrocities didn't help, but that coalition would have formed even if they were squeaky clean.

stay safe out there, folks.
