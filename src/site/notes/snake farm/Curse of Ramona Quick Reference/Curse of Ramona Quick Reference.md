## Main Weapons
**[[Weedwhacker\|Weedwhacker]]**

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Damage: 2
- slow moving
	- basically mines, they shoot in the direction you face, but they move slower than your level 1 in-combat runspeed
	- do not take a [[Tsuchinoko\|Tsuchinoko]] as your first snake with this it will take forever
- [[piercing\|piercing]] -- attacks damage all segments of a snake they contact
- [[persistent\|persistent]] -- long duration.  
	- I haven't seen it despawn yet
	- because of this, and their slow movement, go for a 'saturation' strategy.  Time not spent firing is time not having damage on the field.
	- works best with long snakes that loop lazily
- lv2: larger attacks (honestly it's kinda barely noticable)
- lv3: larger attacks, +1 damage, big disc shoots smaller discs
	- **WARN:** sub-projectiles are grey, look like enemy projectiles
- lv4: +1 damage, double smaller blades
- lv 5: double damage.  2.5x small blade spawns
- lv6: double damage.  2.5x small blade spawns

</div></div>

**[[Pitchfork\|Pitchfork]]**

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



 50 damage
- basically melee
- persists for awhile, but only deals one hit without [[+piercing\|+piercing]] items
- lv2: faster cooldown
- lv3: +30 (1.6x) damage (80 total)
	- most snakes seem to have 50 damage breakpoints
- lv4: +40 damage, double range
- lv5: faster cooldown
- lv6: double fire rate, double damage

</div></div>


**[[Trowels\|Trowels]]**

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- [[piercing\|piercing]] -- attacks damage all segments of a snake they contact
	- seems to hit three plus times per segment compared to the weedwhacker -- maybe attack speed buffs change this
- 3 base damage
- lv2: +1 base damage (4 total)
- lv3: faster fire-rate
- lv4: +2 damage, bigger projectile size
- lv5: faster fire-rate
- lv6: +14 damage, biggest trowel
